Database Setup

store certain fields in local db to handle inventory and user info
pull from api based on data stored in local db


need to store locally:

show id - hits /shows/id
show name
show genres
url to show poster
show summary

with these data points stored locally, we can display this info along with whatever else we gather for the app without hitting the api
since we link to the show poster url instead of getting that from the api, we can still cut down on api calls
